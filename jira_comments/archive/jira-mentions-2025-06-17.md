Hi @@Artem Katnov,  1st A: Weâ€™ll push to prod by the end of today.2nd A: Based on this request, what would be the appropriate categorization for the creatives? DE Option: If they have the template_data.link property, they are assigned as HTML5 â€” but what about the others? Furthermore, this categorization and the creation of the new column are out of scope for the current ticket, and it is too late to include them, as the sprint is about to close. Please contact @@Antoine Dubuc to include it in the next sprint based on its priority. cc:  @@Grover Rivera

@@Antoine Dubuc I cloned the original prod issue for this, but it appears to be happening againâ€¦This is from an agency client: Hi Team, I am working on a proposal this morning and saw a client's data again. I thought we resolved this and are NOT showing these audiences on the platform.  I first saw it under injury. Â  What steps can we take to present this from happening before we scale users?  Thank you! Â   Basically, weâ€™re not filtering out 1st party data segments (segments owned by a specific agency) from being visible from ALL agencies in the Media Planner.   This is powered by the ATS audience targeting service, using data pulled by data team.  We need to filter out any 1P segmentsâ€¦ @@Irina Groylova build a blacklisting tool.  is there a way to see how this one got through blacklisting?   @@Matthew Wurman could you add in the whole segment name here?
