# Squiddles Product Strategy & Design Document

**Project**: Multi-Agent SDLC Voice-Activated Web System  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  

---

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

### **Core Mission**
Build a voice-activated web application that provides unified project visibility and control across developer tools (Jira, Confluence, Slack, Google Workspace) through natural conversation and intelligent visualization.

### **The "Project Constellation" Concept**
A voice-navigable unified view that connects project information scattered across multiple tools, eliminating context switching and providing complete project intelligence through conversation.

---

## 🏗️ **System Architecture Overview**

### **Voice Interface Foundation**
- **Technology**: OpenAI Realtime API + WebRTC
- **UI Design**: Terminal-inspired, developer-focused interface
- **Interaction**: Voice-first with keyboard shortcuts and visual fallbacks

### **The Tentacle System**
Multi-agent tools that integrate with external services:

1. **Tentacle 1 - Jira Integration**: CRUD operations on tickets, projects, sprints
2. **Tentacle 2 - Confluence Integration**: Documentation access and editing
3. **Tentacle 3 - Slack Integration**: Team communication context
4. **Tentacle 4 - Google Workspace**: Document collaboration layer

---

## 🎨 **Design Philosophy**

### **"The Terminal for Voice" - Luna Martinez**
- **Function over form**: Every pixel serves a purpose
- **Voice-first interaction**: Interface adapts to voice, not vice versa
- **Terminal familiarity**: Developers already know this mental model
- **Bold visual feedback**: Clear system status at all times
- **Keyboard accessibility**: Never force mouse interaction

### **Persona-Driven UI Architecture**

#### **Adaptive Interface Strategy**
The UI must morph based on detected user role and current task context, providing role-appropriate information density and workflow optimization.

```typescript
const PersonaDrivenUIStrategy = {
  adaptiveLayout: {
    concept: "UI morphs based on detected user role and current task",
    implementation: "Role-based views with contextual panels",
    personalization: "Learn from usage patterns to optimize layout"
  },
  
  informationHierarchy: {
    developer: "Minimal info, maximum focus",
    teamLead: "Medium density, team-focused",
    manager: "High density, strategic overview",
    designer: "Visual-heavy, implementation tracking"
  },
  
  interactionPatterns: {
    voiceFirst: "All personas use voice as primary input",
    visualFallback: "Rich visual interfaces for complex data",
    keyboardShortcuts: "Power user efficiency for all roles"
  }
};
```

#### **Adaptive UI Framework**

**Context-Aware Interface Switching:**
```typescript
const AdaptiveUIFramework = {
  roleDetection: {
    method: "Authentication + declared role + usage patterns",
    fallback: "User can manually switch modes",
    learning: "AI learns preferred layouts and information density"
  },
  
  contextualAdaptation: {
    timeOfDay: "Morning: planning focus, afternoon: execution focus",
    workflowStage: "Planning vs. development vs. review vs. release",
    urgency: "Incident mode vs. normal operations vs. strategic planning",
    teamSize: "Individual vs. small team vs. large organization views"
  },
  
  informationLayering: {
    level1: "Essential info always visible (voice status, key metrics)",
    level2: "Role-specific primary information (persona-driven)",
    level3: "Detailed drill-down available on demand (voice or click)",
    level4: "Advanced analytics and reporting (executive/manager only)"
  },
  
  voiceContextAwareness: {
    personalizedCommands: "Learn user's preferred command patterns",
    roleBasedSuggestions: "Suggest relevant commands for current context",
    workflowOptimization: "Streamline common persona-specific workflows",
    intelligentDefaults: "Pre-populate based on role and current project state"
  }
};
```

#### **Cross-Persona Design Principles**

**Universal Design Elements:**
```typescript
const UniversalDesignPrinciples = {
  voiceFirst: {
    principle: "Voice interaction is primary for all personas",
    implementation: "Large, prominent voice status indicator",
    accessibility: "Clear audio and visual feedback for all voice states"
  },
  
  contextualClarity: {
    principle: "Always clear what the system can do right now",
    implementation: "Suggested voice commands visible",
    adaptation: "Commands change based on current context and role"
  },
  
  progressiveFeedback: {
    principle: "Immediate acknowledgment, progressive detail",
    implementation: "Voice confirmation → visual update → detailed results",
    personalization: "Detail level adapts to persona preferences"
  },
  
  errorRecovery: {
    principle: "Graceful handling of voice recognition failures",
    implementation: "Text input fallback always available",
    learning: "System learns to handle persona-specific terminology"
  }
};
```

  }
};
```

## 📝 **Decision Log**

### **Key Decisions Made**
1. **Voice Technology**: OpenAI Realtime API chosen over alternatives
2. **UI Philosophy**: Adaptive persona-driven interfaces over single terminal design
3. **Integration Priority**: Jira first, then Confluence, Slack, Google
4. **Visualization Approach**: Role-specific dashboards over one-size-fits-all
5. **Implementation Strategy**: Persona-phased delivery starting with developers
6. **Interface Adaptation**: Context-aware UI morphing based on user role and tasks

### **Open Questions**
1. User persona definition and prioritization
2. Enterprise security requirements and compliance
3. Pricing model and go-to-market strategy
4. Mobile vs. desktop priority
5. Custom workflow vs. standard integration depth

## 🚀 **First UI Implementation: Product Manager User Story Creation**

### **Implementation Decision**
**Priority**: First UI to be built  
**Target Persona**: Jordan Kim (Product Manager)  
**Core Workflow**: AI-assisted user story creation with contextual research

### **Feature Scope**
**Primary Capabilities:**
- Voice-driven user story creation workflow
- AI assistance in structuring user stories using configurable templates
- Pinecone-powered search for related tickets and context
- Integration with Jira for ticket creation

**User Story Template System:**
- Configurable template page where users define story structure
- Example template sections seen in organization:
  - **BUSINESS VALUE**: Why this matters to the organization
  - **CONTEXT**: Background information and current state
  - **SPIKE GOAL**: What needs to be accomplished
  - **INPUTS**: Resources and information sources available
  - **OUTPUTS**: Expected deliverables and artifacts
  - **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: Success conditions and validation
  - **PM REVIEW DATA POINTS**: Review criteria and checkpoints

**Technical Components:**
- Voice intent recognition (AI reasoning, not hardcoded triggers)
- Template configuration management
- Pinecone vector search integration for contextual information
- Jira API integration for ticket creation
- Natural language processing for template population

### **Voice Interaction Patterns**
**Intent Recognition Examples:**
- "I need to write a user story for the checkout flow"
- "Help me create a story about user authentication"
- "Let's document the payment integration requirements"

**AI Understanding:**
- Pure LLM reasoning for intent detection (no keyword matching)
- Contextual understanding based on conversation history
- Natural language instructions guide AI behavior

### **Next Implementation Questions**
1. UI integration approach (separate page vs. voice system mode)
2. Template configuration interface design
3. Pinecone search result presentation
4. Voice-to-template mapping workflow
